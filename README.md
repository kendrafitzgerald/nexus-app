## Description 

 Nexua is a college life social network blog that gives students a platform to discuss their school experiences and connect with other students based on shared interests, universities, or majors. Nexus is a Full-Stack application allows users to sign up and create an account, where they can input profile information, pictures, and write their own posts. Nexus also gives users the ability to view other students' posts, allowing them to ineract with one another. Nexus users can create new posts via their profile. There is a create post button which renders a text box on screen, allowing students to write and submit their own posts. Once posts are created, students can see their posts on their profile, and will notice that their post renders on the homepage as well with other users.
