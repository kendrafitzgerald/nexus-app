# nexus-app

## Description 

Nexus is an app built from scratch for Project 3. Nexus functions as a college life social network blog to give students a platform to discuss their school experiences and connect with other students based on shared interests, universities, or majors without already needing to be immersed in university life. The user is a college student who wants to connect with other students via a blog so that they can see other students' expereinces and interests for references, recommendations and community support.
