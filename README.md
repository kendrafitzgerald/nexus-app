## Description 

Nexus is an app built from scratch for Project 3. Nexus functions as a college life social network blog to give students a platform to discuss their school experiences and connect with other students based on shared interests, universities, or majors without already needing to be immersed in university life. Nexus's standout feature is the ability for students to link their spotify account to post their most recent listening, because shared music taste is a fast track way to find compatibility. The user is a college student who wants to connect with other students via a blog so that they can see other students' expereinces and interests for references, recommendations and community support.
